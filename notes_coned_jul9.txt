Notes from the meeting on 7/9/2015

CONED says: High priority is to get the customer address of the outage. (The street address)
Most important thing is the customer address. 

Verizon needs a specific naming convention of the feeder
 CROWHL  \      CROWHL is all combined (this is the STAR system)
 CROWHL1  \------ these are the same feeder
 CROWHL2  /       these are 3 different feeders but these should be searched for the CROWHL feeder
 CROWHL3 /
 
 Report A CROWHL includes all (customer service address)
 Report B CROWHL132 is individual 


Export time on the report takes too long. We need to eliminate the duplicate lines of the RAW data too. 
Need to have the address on the exported data file CSV from the reporting tab. 


CONED, alongside duration you want a status column that indicates which outage is still happening. 
The status column should have three columns
A               B              C            D          E        F       G
time reported   restored time  duration     status     from     to      system time

status = FAIL or RESTORE

E and F are the begin and end time of the report

If an outage is effect and query the system then the logic for the report is: 
        A = fail time reported
        B = blank
        C = G - A for duration
        D = FAIL
        
If an outage is restored and query the system at or after the restore time, then the logic for the report is: 
        A = time reported
        B = restore time reported
        C = B - A
        D = RESTORE
 
If the start time of the report is in the middle of the outage?
     The report should look at ALL the restore times between the start and end and report those.
     A            B             C            D         E           F        G
     jul 1 12AM                 2 days       FAIL      jun 30      jul 2    jul 3  12AM

     query on jul 15 over the range of jun 30 jul 11
     A            B              C           D         E           F         G 
     jul 1 12AM   jul 10 12 AM   10 days     RESTORE   jun 30      jul 11    jul 15
